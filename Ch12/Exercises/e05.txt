Suppose that a is a one-dimensional array and p is a pointer variable. Assuming that the assignment p = a has just been performed, which of the following expressions are illegal because of mismatched types? Of the remaining expressions, which are true (have a nonzero value)?

(a) p == a[0]
(b) p == &a[0]
(c) *p == a[0]
(d) p[0] == a[0]

Answer:
A - Illegal
B - Legal: evaluates true
C - Legal: evaluates true
D - Legal: evaluates true
