Whick one of the following statements is not equivalent to the other two
(assuming that the loop bodies are the same?)

(a) while (i < 10) {...}
(b) for (; i < 10;) {...}
(c) do {...} while (i < 10);

Answer:
C, because unlike A and B, it executes whatever statements are under it
before doing the first check.
