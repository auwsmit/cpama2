In computer graphics, colors are often stored as three numbers, representing
red, green, and blue intensities. Suppose that each number requires eight bits,
and we'd like to store all three values in a single long integer. Write a macro
named MK_COLOR with three parameters (the red, green, and blue intensities).
MK_COLOR should return a long in which the last three bytes contain red, green,
and blue intensities, with the red value as the last byte and the green value as
the next-to-last byte.

Answer:
#define MK_COLOR(r,b,g) ((long) ((b) << 16) | ((g) << 8) | (r))
