When stored according to the IEEE floating-point standard, a float value
consists of a 1-bit sign (the leftmost-or most significant-bit), an 8-bit
exponent, and a 23-bit fraction, in that order. Design a structure type that
occupies 32 bits, with bit-field members corresponding to the sign, exponent,
and fraction. Declare the bit-fields to have type unsigned int.

Check the manual for your compiler to determine the order of the bit-fields.

Answer:
struct float_bf {
    unsigned int sign: 1;
    unsigned int exp: 8;
    unsigned int frac: 23;
};
